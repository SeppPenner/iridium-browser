Subject: [PATCH 66/66] Disable smooth scrolling on Linux

Smooth scrolling (while using mousewheel or arrow keys) is a really
dumb idea. Text naturally appears as a blur while it moves, and the
animation takes that-many milliseconds to finish, so it's a time
waster too.

Only the fallback setting, which is used on Linux, is changed; on
Windows/MacOS, smooth scrolling remains controlled by a system
setting.
